        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We are a team of scientists working within the Build-a-Cell initiative to design synthetic cells from scratch. To us, this means producing cell-sized mimics engineered directly from molecular ingredients like proteins, DNA, lipids, etc. So far, researchers from around the world, many of whom are involved in ongoing Build-a-Cell projects, have demonstrated that many aspects of cell functions can be replicated in such synthetic systems, including division, protein expression, and the activation of genetic programs from various stimuli. An often encountered limitation in synthetic cell development is the inconsistent yield of functional synthetic cells arising from manual, human-led formation techniques. Issues from manual handling can be inconsistent encapsulation of molecular components, significant polydispersity in size and shape, as well as systematic biases in compositional parameters.

        <h2>Key Challenges in Synthetic Cell Development</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Vesicle Standardization</strong>: Across the synthetic cell field, researchers use a variety of synthetic cell production methods according to the lab's own expertise. Systematic biases unique to each technique limit cross-group comparison and subsequent collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reproducibility</strong>: All current synthetic cell fabrication techniques—including current microfluidic techniques—rely on human input for critical steps in the formation pipeline, which can lead to inconsistencies from experiment to experiment. The subsequent uncertainties slow down the design-test process and can limit our ability to identify optimal design choices.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Automation</strong>: An additional consequence of human-led synthetic cell fabrication is the unsuitability for the screening demands required to systematically explore the vast design spaces in even the most basic synthetic cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Exclusivity of Microfluidics</strong>: For the last few decades, the proliferation of microfluidic techniques has been slow because of the demands of accessing expensive, specialized equipment in microfabrication facilities.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Task for Automation System</strong>: Adjust fluid flows to produce consistent droplet sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Low-Cost System</strong>: Build an integrated system using under $10k lasers, resin printers, and automatic tool-changing milling machines.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Predictable Vesicles</strong>: Formation of a microfluidic device for the <strong>reproducible</strong> production of cell-sized (10-50 micron) lipid vesicle-based synthetic cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Democratized Techniques</strong>: A sub-$10k end-to-end microfluidic chip fabrication system which can reproducibly manufacture devices without expert users.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Automation Tools</strong>: An affordable vision-based microfluidic controller for automation of synthetic cell production.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Completion September 2025</strong>: Within a year, we aim to have delivered a synthetic cell formation device that can be easily disseminated to non-microfluidic labs and operated by a non-expert user.
